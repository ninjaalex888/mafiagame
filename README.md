Title:

	Mafia Game

Description:

	Android app created for the popular party game Mafia with a secret twist.
	All information needed to understand the game itself can be found on wikipedia
	at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)

Vision Statement:

	Give users enjoyable and accurate experience of the Mafia Game

Motivation:

	We all enjoy the Mafia game and we would like to create an app for it that will no require the full body of 8 people that is 			normally a pre requiste for the game 

Risks:

	- No app development experience for most members
	- No extensive knowledge of Java 
	- No prior working experience between the team members 
	- We all have different schedules therefore a aggreeable meeting time may be hard to come up with
	- Not all of us have Android phones and will not be able to deploy the product on to the final product
	
Mitigation:

	Android SDK is not hard to learn and a simple Android app is not hard to do
	Extensive documentation available regarding Android app development

Methodology:

	We plan on using a stretched version of agile or an iterative version of waterfall.  The time periods we will be working
	in is around a week.  Meeting times in class and once a week outside will give our progess its structure.  Each time we meet
	a goal will be set for each person and an overall goal set.  This will be plotted out in the Trello and through github issues.
	Every time we meet the scrum meeting approach will be taken and difficulties assigned using the agile numbering scheme.  Due 
	to not being able to meet every day agile is not appropriate, but by extending the time scale a bit it will work well.
